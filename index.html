    <h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
    <h4 class="sub-title">All About Michal</h4>
    <p class="about-content">I was born and raised in Irvine, California. Growing up, I was always intrigued by web development and design.
        If you ask any of my middle school friends, I always had a pretty MySpace page because i'd spend hours learning
        how to make things work. But as dance took over my life and Facebook became the social media of choice, I
        sidelined my interest in web development. After spending a volunteer gap year in Israel,
        I decided to stay in Israel and pursue my undergraduate degree in Business Administration
        with an emphasis in Finance at IDC Herzliya. Spending an extensive amount of time in Tel Aviv
        sparked my interest in the high-paced tech world. When I returned to America I spent a lot of
        time looking for finance jobs and was not able to find something that sounded worthwhile to me.
        After a few months of working both in retail and non-profit, I knew neither field was for me either.
    </p>
    <h4 class="sub-title">Why LearningFuze?</h4>
    <p class="about-content">A family friend knew about another bootcamp and suggested that I look into it. After spending months
    looking into programs in San Francisco, I realized that I like warm weather too much to move north,
        especially while studying so intensely. Irvine is an up-and-coming tech hub and I felt that it
        would be better to be part of the starting stages than to be another person fighting for a spot in Silicon Valley. </p>
    <h4 class="sub-title">Job Goals</h4>

    <p class="about-content">Ideally, I'd either like to work for a new startup, with a close knit team and help develop the company from
        its infancy through its maturity or work for a company with pop culture elements (like Mashable, Refinery29, etc).
    Pop culture has always been a big part of my life and these are websites I often spend countless hours reading. On the other hand,
        with my new background in Web Development and my Business Administration degree, I feel like I could not only be part of
        the technical team of a company, but that I would also have valuable input on the business end.</p>
